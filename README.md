# Wooden Menagerie

This is a collection of files for creating articulated wooden animals. The four animals that can be created are a giraffe, an elephant, and alligator, and an octopus. All of the individual files and assemblies are within these folders.

## Materials

It is recommended to use 1/8" birch plywood or other 1/8" material for the animals. They were designed to be cut on laser cutter to reduce material waste.

The laser that they were originally created on had a bed size that would only fit 12" x 24" pieces of birch plywood, so the pre-nested files will fit onto material of that size.

These were also designed to use wooden 3/16" dowels from any Home Depot or Lowe's.

## Process

After cutting all of the pieces on a laser or other machine, it is time to assemble. For mine, I used super glue to permanently attach parts together. It is easiest to have the assembly open while putting the animal together so that you can see where different parts go.

Testing with a dry fit is encouraged, when all pieces are together, add super glue to the places that hold the dowels to keep everything together. Some areas that act as pivot points require only glue on the outer parts that touch the dowel, otherwise the pivot point won't work because they will all be glued together.
